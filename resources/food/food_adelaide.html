	<b>Assaggio</b> (<a href="http://hydepark.assaggio.com.au/">link</a>), King William Rd, Hyde Park.
	<p class="commentary">
	This is an award winning Italian restaurant in the south of Adelaide. They use fresh

	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Est Pizzeria</b> (<a href="http://www.estpizzeria.com.au/">link</a>), East Terrace, Adelaide CBD.
	<p class="commentary">

	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Osteria Oggi</b> (<a href="http://osteriaoggi.com.au/">link</a>), Pirie St, Adelaide CBD.
	<p class="commentary">
